    <h2>Description</h2>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1/2 tbsp oil</li>
            <li>8 sausages of choice</li>
            <li>1 large onion</li>
            <li>2 garlic cloves</li>
            <li>3 tbsp flour</li>
            <li>2 cups beef stock/broth</li>
            <li>1/4 tsp salt</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp black pepper</li>
            <li>mashed potato</li>
            <li>peas</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Cook Sausages:</strong> Heat oil in a large skillet / fry pan over medium high heat. Add sausages and cook, turning, until browned as much as possible all over and cooked through. Cook time will differ depending on sausage size, mine take around 8 minutes.</li>
            <li><strong>Remove sausages</strong> onto a plate. Turn heat down to medium.</li>
            <li><strong>2 tbsp oil remaining:</strong> You need around 2 tbsp oil left in the skillet. If you have much less, add a bit of butter or oil.</li>
            <li><strong>Saute onion and garlic:</strong> Add onion and garlic, cook until golden brown, around 4 minutes.</li>
            <li><strong>Cook off flour 2 minutes:</strong> Add flour and mix through. Then cook, stirring constantly for 2 minutes.</li>
            <li><strong>Gradually add beef stock</strong> Add about 3/4 cup of beef broth and mix into the onion so it becomes a sludge. Then add remaining beef broth and mix until combined. If it's lumpy, use a whisk to help make it smooth.</li>
            <li><strong>Thicken Gravy:</strong> Simmer, stirring, for 2 to 3 minutes until the gravy thickens but is slightly thinner than you want, it will thicken more as you serve it.</li>
            <li><strong>Season</strong> Add salt and pepper. Stir, taste, then add more salt if you want.</li>
            <li><strong>Serve</strong> sausages with plenty of gravy, with mashed potato and peas on the side.</li>
        </ol>
